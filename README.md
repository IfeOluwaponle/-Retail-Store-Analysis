### Online Retail-Store-Analysis Power BI
--PowerBI analysis, Dashboard, and Reporting

This dashboard answers four key business questions of an online retail store looking to expand sales and gain insights into best selling product :

Question 1
Understanding the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only.I created a granular data by looking into revenue for each month and generating seasonal trends and highlight any changes. This analysis will be helpful to forecast revenue for the next year.

Question 2
The top 10 countries generating the highest revenue and the quantity sold along with the revenue generated (excluding the United Kingdom, based on business requirements discussed during Stakeholders meeting). 

Question 3
The top 10 customers by revenue. created a visual that shows the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. This helps to target the higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4
Gain insights into the demand for Company products.  created insights on regions that have the greatest demand for specific products. This will help initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business/ revenue from these regions.


As a data analyst, here is my go-to checklist.
* Plan the project (get business understanding and stakeholders requirement)
* Get the data (ensure all the data required are available and ready to use)
* Prepare the data (ensure data is in right format and ready to be extracted from database for analysis and visualization)
* Perform ETL (extract, transform and load dataset into Power BI)
* feature engineering (if need be; create tables, measures )
* vizualize and dashboards
* create a report
